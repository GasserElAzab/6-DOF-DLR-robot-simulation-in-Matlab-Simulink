# 6-DOF-DLR-robot-simulation-in-Matlab-Simulink
This is the full analysis of the forward, inverse kinematics, trajectory planning, path planning, and controlling the end effector.

The project is divided into five Milestones, that are combined all together in the Full block.

The projects includes all the forward and inverse kinematic analysis (position, velocity, and acceleration) as well as dynamics analysis. 

It also includes Trajectory and Path planning algorithms to make a certain shape(as cone and ellipse). In addition to that, a PID controller was also utilized on this robot to control it smoothly. 

You can check the final report for more illustration.
